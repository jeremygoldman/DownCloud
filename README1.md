# Soundcloud-Like-DL
Python script using Selenium &amp; IFTTT to download a track and its album art whenever I like a new track on SoundCloud

Uses below IFTTT recipe to monitor SoundCloud likes. If a new track is liked, the track's title and URL will be appended to the end of the file.

MAKE SURE TO MODIFY YOUR FILE LOCATION AND DOWNLOAD DIRECTORY IN THE FILE!!

THE SCRIPT WILL NOT WORK CORRECTLY IF IT IS NOT POINTED TO THE CORRECT .txt FILE AND A VALID DOWNLOAD LOCATION!!
