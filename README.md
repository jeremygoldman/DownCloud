# Soundcloud-Like-DL
Python script using Selenium &amp; IFTTT to download a track and its album art whenever I like a new track on SoundCloud

Uses [this IFTTT recipe](https://goo.gl/556rKd) to monitor SoundCloud likes. If a new track is liked, the track's title and URL will be appended to the end of the file.

To install Selenium, run: `pip install selenium` or follow the instructions [here](http://goo.gl/JmxrPT)

##Make sure to modify your .txt file locationa nd download directory in the file

##The script will not work correctly if it is not pointed to the correct .txt file and a valid download location
